# Getting Started

If you're new to Mimbres, start with the intro courses:

- What is Money
- Alliance, Affinity, and Interdependence
- Political Theology

Everybody brings something of value to the table, whether it's their particular
life knowledge or even just a willingness to ask stupid questions. the latter is
something we value very highly
