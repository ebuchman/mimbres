*Are you feeling intellectually under-stimulated? Do you crave high-level,
in-depth discussion of philosophy, politics, economics, and more, with a
rigorous grounding in primary sources? If so, Mimbres School may be the right
place for you. Mimbres School is not for everyone. If you are a committed and
earnest Marxist or Republican, talk to your doctor before joining Mimbres
School. Common side effects include feeling inadequate due to being unable to
keep up with the full amount of assigned reading, and becoming even more
intolerable at parties than you already were ...*

Mimbres is a new school.

It's the humanities:
- without disciplinary boundaries
- with primary sources
- without fear of asking hard questions 
- with a long view

An anti-university.
